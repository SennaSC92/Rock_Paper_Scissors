# Rock_Paper_Scissors
This is an assignment I am doing with the Odin Project to further my JavaScript skills.

I learnt how to do the following:

* Use math.random/math.floor to create random selection.
* How to use functions in more depth.
* Using for loops to create a game loop.

I found this challengin but I didin't give up and am very pleased that I did complete it. I have gained more knowledge and understanding surrounding functions and loops.
